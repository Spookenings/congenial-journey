Gushing over Magical Girls (Japanese: 魔法少女にあこがれて, Hepburn: Mahō Shōjo ni Akogarete), known as I admire magical girls, and... in Japan, is a Japanese magical girl manga series written and illustrated by Akihiro Ononaka.

Utena Hiiragi is a normal, introverted girl with a strong admiration for magical girls, especially the beautiful trio that protect her town, Tres Magia. One day, a mascot named Venalita approaches Utena and gives her magical powers, but rather than becoming the magical girl of justice she always wanted to be, she instead becomes an evil general of the Enormita organization. Despite the misfortune in being forced to fight against the magical girls she admires, Utena soon discovers that she has a hidden sadistic side, and revels in torturing her former idols with her newfound obsession.
